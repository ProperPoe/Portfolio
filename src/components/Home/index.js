         <p>I've been learning coding languages, and computer programming since July 20th, 2020. Since then i've learned C, C++, Python, Javascript, SQL, HTML, CSS/SASS, ReactJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, and NodeJS. Although i've mainly focused on Web Development mostly, I have a passion to learn other areas of computer programming.</p>
